# Argument-Parser
This repo contains an Argument Parser program in which the user can add his/her arguments to the command line, separated by spaces. The arguments can be numbers, words, or letters. Some arguments can also contain one or two dashes if front of the argument to denote it as an optional argument.
	-**Note:** The Readme will only cover a few of the classes involved with the program.
